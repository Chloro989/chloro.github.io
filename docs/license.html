                To the extent possible under law, chloro has waived all copyright<br>
                and related or neighboring rights to this work.<br>
                <br>
                The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically<br>
                confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the<br>
                creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an &quot;owner&quot;) of an<br>
                original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a &quot;Work&quot;).<br>
                <br>
                Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work<br>
                for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and<br>
                scientific works (&quot;Commons&quot;) that the public can reliably and without<br>
                fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate<br>
                in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any<br>
                form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation<br>
                commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to<br>
                promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of<br>
                creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or<br>
                greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and<br>
                efforts of others.<br>
                <br>
                For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any<br>
                expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person<br>
                associating CC0 with a Work (the &quot;Affirmer&quot;), to the extent that he or<br>
                she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,<br>
                voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute<br>
                the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and<br>
                Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect<br>
                of CC0 on those rights.<br>
                <br>
                1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may<br>
                be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights<br>
                (&quot;Copyright and Related Rights&quot;). Copyright and Related Rights<br>
                include, but are not limited to, the following:<br>
                <br>
                the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,<br>
                communicate, and translate a Work; moral rights retained by the<br>
                original author(s) and/or performer(s); publicity and privacy<br>
                rights pertaining to a person&#x27;s image or likeness depicted in a<br>
                Work; rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a<br>
                Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below; rights<br>
                protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in<br>
                a Work; database rights (such as those arising under Directive<br>
                96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March<br>
                1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national<br>
                implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version<br>
                of such directive); and other similar, equivalent or corresponding<br>
                rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and<br>
                any national implementations thereof.<br>
                <br>
                2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in<br>
                contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully,<br>
                permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and<br>
                surrenders all of Affirmer&#x27;s Copyright and Related Rights and<br>
                associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown<br>
                (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in<br>
                the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum<br>
                duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time<br>
                extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number<br>
                of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without<br>
                limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the<br>
                &quot;Waiver&quot;). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of<br>
                the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer&#x27;s heirs and<br>
                successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to<br>
                revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal<br>
                or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the<br>
                public as contemplated by Affirmer&#x27;s express Statement of Purpose.<br>
                <br>
                3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any<br>
                reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,<br>
                then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted<br>
                taking into account Affirmer&#x27;s express Statement of Purpose. In<br>
                addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants<br>
                to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non<br>
                sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to<br>
                exercise Affirmer&#x27;s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in<br>
                all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by<br>
                applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in<br>
                any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)<br>
                for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,<br>
                advertising or promotional purposes (the &quot;License&quot;). The License shall<br>
                be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the<br>
                Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally<br>
                invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity<br>
                or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,<br>
                and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)<br>
                exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in<br>
                the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action<br>
                with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer&#x27;s<br>
                express Statement of Purpose.<br>
                <br>
                4. Limitations and Disclaimers.<br>
                <br>
                No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,<br>
                abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this<br>
                document. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no<br>
                representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work,<br>

                limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a<br>
                particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or<br>
                other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors,<br>
                whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent<br>
                permissible under applicable law. Affirmer disclaims<br>
                responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply<br>
                to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any<br>
                person&#x27;s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further,<br>
                Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary<br>
                consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the<br>
                Work. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons<br>
                is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with<br>
